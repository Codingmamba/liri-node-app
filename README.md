LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.
